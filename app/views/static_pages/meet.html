             <p>The annual E-week carnival is one of the most highly anticipated events of the week! This yearâ€™s carnival will feature, snacks, music, games, and of course lots and lots of pie. This event is a fun way to see what different clubs do and for you to meet fellow engineers outside an academic setting. If you have an idea for a carnival game as part of a club, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/forms/d/10dxc5jU9jk-LiBQEPRJi4nfdxqN1hFHw4_74P38YW_Y/viewform" target="_blank">sign up</a> to do a booth!</p>
